------------------------------------------


This repository contains a MATLAB script for graphing multiple mathematical functions on a single plane.

## Script

The MATLAB script in this repository plots 12 different mathematical functions on a single plane. The functions include square roots, absolute values, and other complex mathematical expressions. The script uses the `plot` function to graph each function and the `hold on` command to overlay the graphs on a single plane.

## Usage

To run the script, simply open it in MATLAB and press the Run button. Make sure you have MATLAB installed on your computer.
