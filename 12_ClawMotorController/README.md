------------------------------------------

This project is about designing a circuit to control the motor of a claw based on deformations in a specific area. The design takes into account the maximum and minimum voltage accepted by the microcontroller and its proportionality with the deformation, with a maximum value of 5V.

## Design Considerations

The design of the circuit considers the maximum and minimum voltage that the microcontroller can accept. This is crucial as it ensures the safe and efficient operation of the motor controller. The design also takes into account the proportionality between the voltage and the deformation, with a maximum value of 5V.

## Multisim Design Files

The `.ms14` file extension is associated with **Multisim 14**, a circuit design and simulation software developed by National Instruments. 

`.MS14` files are the primary file format for circuit designs created in Multisim 14. They contain a schematic diagram of the circuit, including all electronic components, connections, and settings. This may include diodes, components connectors, indicators, and peripherals.

Multisim appends a number to circuit design file extensions, which indicates the version of Multisim that created the design. For example, Multisim 12 uses the `.MS12` file extension and Multisim 13 uses the `.MS13` file extension for saving designs. Also, Multisim supports older project formats, which means that version 14 of Multisim can open an `.MS9` design created by version 9 of Multisim.

To open an `.MS14` file, you can simply double-click the file or select File â†’ Open in the Multisim software. If you're having trouble opening these files, make sure you have the latest version of NI Multisim installed on your system.
